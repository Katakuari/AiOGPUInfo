# GPUInfo #
GPUInfo is a Rainmeter skin to monitor your GPUs status (temp, fan speed, etc).

This skin was inspired by [Raion1337](https://www.deviantart.com/raion1337)'s [CPUStats](https://www.deviantart.com/raion1337/art/CPUStats-Temperature-and-Usage-568402322).

## Prerequisites ##
To use this skin, you will have to install [HWiNFO](https://www.hwinfo.com/) and configure it as explained in the [Rainmeter Docs](https://docs.rainmeter.net/tips/hwinfo/).

You will likely have to edit the `Value` numbers in the measures (e.g. `Value1`, `ValueRaw4`) according to what HWiNFO assigns to the sensors.

## Prerequisites ##
To use this skin, you will have to install [HWiNFO](https://www.hwinfo.com/) and configure it as explained in the [Rainmeter Docs](https://docs.rainmeter.net/tips/hwinfo/).

You will likely have to edit the `Value` numbers in the measures like `Value1` or `ValueRaw4` according to what HWiNFO assigns to the sensors.

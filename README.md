# GPUInfo #
GPUInfo is a Rainmeter skin to monitor your GPUs status (temp, fan speed, etc).

## Prerequisites ##
To use this skin, you will have to install [HWiNFO](https://www.hwinfo.com/) and configure it as explained in the [Rainmeter Docs](https://docs.rainmeter.net/tips/hwinfo/).

You will likely have to edit the `Value` numbers in the measures (e.g. `Value1`, `ValueRaw4`) according to what HWiNFO assigns to the sensors.

The used font is optional and can be changed freely. If you want to use the included one, here's a link to the official download at [JetBrains.com](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/).

## Inspirations ##
This skin was inspired by the following skin:
